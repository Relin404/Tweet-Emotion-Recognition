# Tweet Emotion Recognition using TensorFlow

This repository contains an IPython Notebook that demonstrates the training of a recurrent neural network using TensorFlow to recognize emotions in tweets. The dataset used for training consists of thousands of tweets, each classified into one of six emotions. The task at hand is a multi-class classification problem in the domain of natural language processing.
